#  Project Name: Sales_Analysis.
#### Description:
 **In a bid to learn and practice on using Pandas, this is a project  that extensively analyses a U.S.A based Sales Data-set and try visualize it and bring a much sensible meaning out of the data.**

 ## Background information:

 In this project I used Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib to analyse a large dataset of electronic store purchases base on month, state, cost as key parameters while answering some key business questions.
 Started  by cleaning the given data. This involve;
 - Droping Nun-numbers from the DataFrame
 - Concat 12 months cvs files into one csv file using Pandas.
 - Removing/adding rows based on a condition.
 - Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
 Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section and simple graphical visualization using matplotlib
 - What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
